Development Checklist
===================

When adding a feature to the API, check you have done all necessary steps from the following:

  * updated docstrings for any new functions, classes or modules
  * updated docstrings for any functions where you changed the parameter list
  * written unit tests
  * written loopback tests
  * published the version of quick2wire-gpio-admin that the API relies upon to dist.quick2wire.com
  * updated the getting-started documentation.

If you changed gpio-admin, also:

  * updated the usage message
  * updated the man page
