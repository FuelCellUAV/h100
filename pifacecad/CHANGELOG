Change Log
==========

v2.0.6
------
- Added reference to examples location after installation instructions.
- Added included examples section in docs.

v2.0.5
------
- Fixed a bug in LCDQuestion.

v2.0.4
------
- Fixed a typo in the docs.

v2.0.3
------
- Updated documentation. Examples page, creating custom bitmaps and tools.
- Fixed bug in LCDQuestion.

v2.0.2
------
- Updated lirc docs.

v2.0.1
------
- Fixed init bug where display_control and other vars would not exist.

v2.0.0
------
- Updated for compatibility with pifacecommon v4.0.0.
- All occurrences of `board_num` have been replaced with `hardware_addr` which
  is more appropriate.
- PiFace Control and Display is initialised when you instantiate the object.
  **You do not need to call pifacecad.init() any more.**
- PiFaceCAD inherits registers from MCP23S17 so you can access all the
  registers on the chip. For example GPPUP:

      >>> cad = PiFaceCAD()
      >>> cad.gppub.value = 0xff
      >>> cad.gppub.bits[4].value = 1

- SwitchEventListener now requires that you provide a chip object, not
  a hardware_addr (board_num). This defaults to PiFaceCAD(hardware_addr=0).
- Interrupt events contain a chip object representing the calling chip instead
  of the hardware_addr (board_num). You can still access the
  hardware_addr (board_num) like so:

      >>> def my_callback(event):
      ...     print(event.chip.hardware_addr)

- Removed the Switch class. It added arbitrary restrictions and
  was not very useful. `pifacecommon.mcp23s17.MCP23S17RegisterBit` is more
  appropriate.
- Updated examples to reflect new changes.
- See the docs (particularly the examples) for more information.

v1.1.3 *ignore*
---------------
- Fixed weather.py example (import sys).

v1.1.2 *ignore*
---------------
- Fixed toggle_mask bug and updated test_switches.

v1.1.1 *ignore*
---------------
- Updated for compatibility with pifacecommon v4.0.0.
  *v2.0.0 note: this is a lie, the 4.0.0 version of  pifacecommon that
  this point talks about was never merged into master. Ignore all
  versions of pifacecad up until v2.0.0*

v1.1.0
------
- Added bus and chip select.
- Added board detection and optional board initialisation.
- Added IODIR_FALLING_EDGE and IODIR_RISING_EDGE (see pifacecommon v3.1.1).
- Updated radio example to use a more sensible `prog` name for LIRC and to
  use the custom lircrc file at the Debian examples location. Also added
  mplayer detection and ability to operate without lirc configured.
- Fixed Python 2 support in tools.scanf.
- Limited support for some examples (Radio, Weather and Train Times are
  Python 3 only). Feel free to add in support and submit a patch. :)

v1.0.0
------
- Initial release.
